                    My approach to software is rooted in user empathy and product focus.

                <li>
                    I get stuff done and I have a good time while I'm at it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People say that I bring energy, innovation, and focus to every team that Iâ€™m a part of.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The only thing I like better than learning new technology is using boring old tools that just work :)

                    I'm at my best when working with a solid team on a challenging project in a fast-paced environment.
